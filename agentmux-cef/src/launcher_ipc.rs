// Phase B.2: host-side client for the launcher's named-pipe IPC
// server. Connects on host startup, sends `Register`, holds the
// connection open for the host's lifetime.
//
// Today (B.2) the connection is fire-and-hold — we Register and
// then leave the read half idle. B.3 will start receiving `Event`s
// from the launcher (state changes), B.4 will send `Command`s up,
// B.7 will bridge events to the renderer process.
//
// Activated only when `AGENTMUX_LAUNCHER_PIPE` is set (production
// portable / installed paths after PR #571 + this PR). Absent →
// `task dev` mode where launcher isn't in the loop; host runs as
// before.
