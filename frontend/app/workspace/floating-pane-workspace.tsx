/**
 * FloatingPaneWorkspace — minimal chromeless workspace for the floating
 * window opened by `open_floating_pane_window` (SPEC_FLOATING_PANE_TEAROFF
 * Phase 2 / issue #1077).
 *
 * The floating window's backend state is a normal workspace+tab+block
 * (created by `TearOffBlock` in the source window). The standard
 * `initApp` → `initHostNewWindow` path picks it up via `?workspaceId=`
 * and populates atoms the same as any new window. What changes here vs.
 * the docked `<Workspace />` component is *only* the rendered chrome:
 *
 *  - no `<WindowHeader>` (which carries the tab bar + action widgets)
 *  - no `<StatusBar>`
 *  - no extra title bar — the floater renders the block's standard
 *    pane header (from `BlockFrame_Header` in `block/blockframe.tsx`)
 *    as its sole chrome. Dragging the pane header's title area moves
 *    the floating window via the host's `floating_pane_wndproc` →
 *    `WM_NCHITTEST → HTCAPTION` shim (excluding the rightmost ~130 CSS
 *    px where the per-pane action buttons live, so close / magnify /
 *    mic / endIconButtons remain clickable).
 *
 * The frontend code path is otherwise identical to the docked case:
 * Block / view-model / RPC subscriptions all behave the same.
