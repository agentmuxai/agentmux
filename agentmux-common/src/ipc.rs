//! Phase B.2 IPC wire protocol — shared between agentmux-launcher
//! (server) and agentmux-cef (client). One source of truth so the
//! Command / Event shapes can't drift between binaries on a
//! version-skew release.
//!
//! See `specs/SPEC_WINDOW_PROCESS_STATE_MACHINE_2026_04_27.md` §5.
//!
//! Wire format: newline-delimited JSON. One message per line,
//! parsed via serde_json. Format chosen for debuggability —
//! operators can `cat` / `nc` the named pipe and read traffic
//! without a binary protocol decoder.
//!
//! Backward compat policy (B.2 baseline; harden in Phase D):
//!   * Externally tagged enums (`{"cmd":"register",...}`) so adding
//!     variants is non-breaking; clients send what they know.
//!   * Unknown commands → server replies `Event::Error` rather than
//!     crashing.
//!   * `version: u64` on every Event lets Phase D's GetSnapshot /
//!     resync detect skew. For B.2 it's set but not enforced.
